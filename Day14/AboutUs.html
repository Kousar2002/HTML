                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>
                    In 2012, Ambareesh Murty and Ashish Shah pioneered omnichannel retail to launch Pepperfry, India’s leading e-commerce marketplace for furniture and home goods.
                    In the last decade, Pepperfry has disrupted the tenets of classical retail by combining an online virtual catalogue, an extensive in-house supply chain, and a large omnichannel footprint covering more than 100 cities in India. Life can be a ‘bed of roses’ (if the bed is from Pepperfry).

                                Pioneers of the omnichannel business model, Pepperfry opened its first Studio (a ‘one-of-a-kind’ experience center) in 2014.
